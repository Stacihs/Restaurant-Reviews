# Restaurant Reviews Udacity Project

This is a project required for fulfillment of the Udacity Front End Web Nanodegree program. It is a mock restaurant finder web application. The user can look up different restaurants by neighborhood or type of cuisine. Reviews are provided to help users make a choice.

## Project Task

The task was to make necessary changes to code provided to us, by Udacity. The site had to be responsive across various platforms, have accessibility features, and make the page available offline, all while keeping it's functionality. Files I added were the sw.js and media_queries.css files. The service worker file contains code I wrote to allow caching of files so that the user can access the web app offline. This demonstrates our ability to adjust code written by someone else and make it comply to specifications that were given to us.
